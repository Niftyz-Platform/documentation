# Enterprise Features

# Additional security

Niftyz internal key backup is done using RSA keys, by creating an enterprise solution you can decide to attach your own RSA key to make backups so you can be 100% confident that we cannot access those keys. Of course some features like account recovery will not work anymore out of the box.

# End to End encryption

Niftyz accounts can be equipped with additional keys which can be used to encrypt all the informations while using the allowlist. This means that each NFT produced is encrypted with different keys, one for each receiver, and only the reciver will be able to unlock and decrypt metadata and attached files.

# Customised collections

By creating an enterprise solution we also switch the smart contract, which can be owned by the company and can run on a different chain (if requested). Minting prices will be changed accordingly with gas fees of the chosen chain.

# Simple accounting

Mintings are not paid one by one, based on volume and usage we'll charge a monthly fee making the accounting simple as it should be for a business. Currently default volume is locked to 5000 NFTs/mo. If you need higher limits please write down in your request.
