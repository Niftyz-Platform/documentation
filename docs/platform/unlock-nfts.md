# Unlock NFTs

To unlock your NFT on Niftyz Pro, simply log in to your account and access the NFT you want to unlock. Then, click on the "Unlock" button and follow the prompts to verify your identity and pay the unlock fee through their Metamask. Once the fee is paid, the NFT will be unlocked and you can access the content associated with it.

For Niftyz Lite, when you receive an NFT, you will need to mint it in order to unlock the content. This requires two main steps. First, log in to your account to verify your identity. Then, sign the request with your wallet to mint and unlock your NFT. Note that the creator pays for the listing fee, so the person who mints the NFT and unlocks the content will not be charged gas fees.
