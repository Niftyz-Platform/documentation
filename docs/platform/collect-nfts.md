# Collect NFTs

Here is how users can collect NFTs on Niftyz Pro:

Once an NFT is created and listed for sale on the platform, interested buyers can purchase the NFT using cryptocurrency such as Ethereum. After purchasing the NFT, the buyer can then collect it and store it in their own wallet.

To ensure secure and seamless transactions, Niftyz Pro integrates with Metamask, a popular digital wallet for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Users can log in to Niftyz Pro using their Metamask wallet and manage their NFTs directly from the platform.

Overall, Niftyz Pro offers a powerful and user-friendly platform for businesses and brands to monetize their digital assets through the creation and sale of NFTs.

Whereas for Niftyz Lite, these are the steps:

When a user receives an NFT, they will need to mint it before they can unlock the content. This requires two main steps:

- First, they need to log in to verify their identity, and then they have to sign the request with their wallet to mint and unlock your NFT. 
- The user who mints the NFT and unlocks the content will never be charged gas fees, as the creator pays for a listing fee that covers this. 

This is the key difference between collecting an NFT with Niftys Lite and Niftyz Pro, as the person who receives and mints the NFT with Niftyz Pro, will be charged gas fees as per the Ethereum network, which may vary.
