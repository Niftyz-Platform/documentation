# Register a new account

Getting started with Niftyz is easy! To use our API, you'll first need to register an account on either Niftyz Lite or Niftyz Pro.
Niftyz Lite Registration

- Go to the Niftyz Lite homepage and click the "Create Wallet" button if you don't have a wallet, or "Log In" if you already have a wallet.
- If you don't have a wallet, fill out the registration form with your email and a strong password. You will then be taken to a page where you can create a new wallet and start creating NFTs using fiat currency.
- If you already have a wallet, simply log in to your account and start creating NFTs straight away.

Niftyz Pro Registration

- Go to the Niftyz Pro homepage and purchase your membership by clicking the "Purchase Membership" button. This is a one-time fee of 0.2 ETH.
- After purchasing your membership, log into the platform through your MetaMask wallet and start creating NFTs right away.

That's it! With just a few simple steps, you can start using the Niftyz API to create, buy, and sell NFTs. If you have any questions or issues with the registration process, please don't hesitate to contact our support team for assistance.
