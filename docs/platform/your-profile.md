# Your profile

Niftyz Pro: To create an account with Niftyz Pro, you will need to purchase a membership by paying a one-time fee of 0.2 ETH. Once you have purchased your membership, you can log in to the platform through your Metamask wallet and start creating NFTs right away. 
As part of your membership, you will receive a unique Niftyz Badge, which is essentially a QR code that represents your identity on-chain. You can share this badge with others by displaying it on your website, business cards, or promotional materials. 

Niftyz Lite: To create an account with Niftyz Lite, simply click on the "Create Wallet" button and follow the prompts. Once you have created your wallet, you will also have created an account. 
To access your account, click on your icon on the top right-hand corner of the page. Here you can customize your profile, change the top banner, add your logo or photo, and add a bio. 
Your profile is visible, so you can share it with others through the QR code available on the page. In this area, you will also be able to see all the NFTs that you have created and collected and share them with others.
